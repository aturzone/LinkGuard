LinkGuard - Offline Link Safety Checker

Protect every click with real-time, 100% offline link safety scoring. LinkGuard analyzes URLs before you navigate, showing a safety percentage score so you know if a link is safe, suspicious, or dangerous — all without sending any data to external servers.

KEY FEATURES:

- Safety Score (0-100%) for every URL you encounter
- 5 Heuristic Analyzers: Domain reputation, URL structure, protocol safety, content patterns, and behavioral analysis
- Warning Overlay: Intercepts risky links with a detailed breakdown before navigation
- Block Page: Prevents navigation to highly dangerous URLs
- Hover Tooltips: See scores on any link just by hovering
- Badge Indicator: Color-coded safety score right on the toolbar icon
- Enterprise Config: Export/import JSON configuration files for organization-wide deployment
- Scan History: Track all analyzed URLs with timestamps
- Customizable Thresholds: Set your own warning and block score levels
- Allowlist & Blocklist: Whitelist trusted domains, block known threats

WHAT LINKGUARD DETECTS:

- Phishing attempts and brand impersonation
- Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .xyz, .top, etc.)
- IP-based URLs and encoded credentials
- URL shortener redirects
- Homograph/punycode attacks (IDN spoofing)
- Data exfiltration patterns
- Open redirect vulnerabilities
- DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) domains via entropy analysis
- Double-encoded URLs and obfuscation
- Dangerous file download links
- Non-HTTPS connections

PRIVACY FIRST:

LinkGuard works 100% offline. No data is ever sent to external servers. All analysis happens locally in your browser using heuristic algorithms. No accounts, no tracking, no cloud dependencies.

ENTERPRISE READY:

Security managers can create a configuration file with allowlists, blocklists, custom patterns, and threshold settings, then distribute it across the organization. Team members simply import the JSON config file.
